    <h2>Cell Structure</h2>

    <h3>Animal and Eukaryotic Cells</h3>
    <p><strong>Nucleus</strong> – contains genetic material and controls cell activities.</p>
    <p><strong>Mitochondria</strong> – site of aerobic respiration; releases energy.</p>
    <p><strong>Ribosomes</strong> – where proteins are made.</p>
    <p><strong>Cell membrane</strong> – controls what enters and leaves the cell.</p>
    <p><strong>Cytoplasm</strong> – where most chemical reactions take place.</p>

    <h3>Plant Cell Structures</h3>
    <p><strong>Cell wall</strong> – strengthens the cell and supports its shape.</p>
    <p><strong>Chloroplasts</strong> – site of photosynthesis; contain chlorophyll.</p>
    <p><strong>Permanent vacuole</strong> – contains cell sap and maintains turgor pressure.</p>

    <h2>Prokaryotic Cells</h2>
    <p>Prokaryotic cells are smaller and simpler than eukaryotic cells.</p>
    <p>They do not have a nucleus; genetic material is free in the cytoplasm.</p>
    <p>They may contain plasmids.</p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>

    <details>
        <summary>What is the function of the nucleus?</summary>
        Contains genetic material and controls the activities of the cell.
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Which structures are found in plant cells but not animal cells?</summary>
        Cell wall, chloroplasts, and a permanent vacuole.
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>What is the role of the mitochondria?</summary>
        Site of aerobic respiration where energy is released.
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Give one difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.</summary>
        Prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus; eukaryotic cells do.
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Where does protein synthesis occur?</summary>
        On ribosomes.
