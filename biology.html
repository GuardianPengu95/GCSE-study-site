    <h1>Biology – AQA GCSE (Higher)</h1>

    <h2>Cell Structure</h2>
    
    <h2>Plant Cells</h2>
    <p><strong>Cell wall</strong> – strengthens the cell and supports its shape.</p>
    <p><strong>Chloroplasts</strong> – site of photosynthesis; contain chlorophyll.</p>
    <p><strong>Permanent vacuole</strong> – contains cell sap and maintains turgor pressure.</p>

    <p><strong>Nucleus</strong> – contains genetic material and controls cell activities.</p>
    <p><strong>Mitochondria</strong> – site of aerobic respiration; releases energy.</p>
    <p><strong>Ribosomes</strong> – where proteins are made.</p>
    <p><strong>Cell membrane</strong> – controls what enters and leaves the cell.</p>
    <p><strong>Cytoplasm</strong> – where most chemical reactions take place.</p>

    <h2>Prokaryotic Cells</h2>

    <p>Prokaryotic cells are smaller and simpler than eukaryotic cells.</p>
    <p>They do not have a nucleus; genetic material is free in the cytoplasm.</p>
    <p>They may contain plasmids.</p>

    
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the function of the nucleus?</li>
        <li>Which structures are found in plant cells but not animal cells?</li>
        <li>What is the role of the mitochondria?</li>
        <li>Give one difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.</li>
        <li>Where does protein synthesis occur?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cell Division</h2>
