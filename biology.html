    <h1>Biology – AQA GCSE (Higher)</h1>

    <h2>Animal Cells</h2>
    <p><strong>Nucleus</strong> – contains genetic material (DNA) and controls the activities of the cell.</p>
    <p><strong>Mitochondria</strong> – site of aerobic respiration, where energy is released.</p>
    <p><strong>Ribosomes</strong> – site of protein synthesis.</p>
    <p><strong>Cell membrane</strong> – controls the movement of substances into and out of the cell.</p>
    <p><strong>Cytoplasm</strong> – gel-like substance where most chemical reactions take place, controlled by enzymes.</p>

    <h2>Plant Cells</h2>
    <p><strong>Cell wall</strong> – made of cellulose; strengthens the cell and supports its shape.</p>
    <p><strong>Chloroplasts</strong> – site of photosynthesis; contain chlorophyll which absorbs light energy.</p>
    <p><strong>Permanent vacuole</strong> – contains cell sap and maintains turgor pressure to keep the cell rigid.</p>

    <p><em>Plant cells also contain all structures found in animal cells.</em></p>

    <h2>Prokaryotic Cells (Bacterial Cells)</h2>
    <p><strong>Cytoplasm</strong> – where chemical reactions take place.</p>
    <p><strong>Cell membrane</strong> – controls movement of substances into and out of the cell.</p>
    <p><strong>Cell wall</strong> – supports the cell; not made of cellulose.</p>
    <p><strong>Circular DNA</strong> – genetic material that controls the cell; not enclosed in a nucleus.</p>
    <p><strong>Plasmids</strong> – small rings of DNA that can carry genes such as antibiotic resistance.</p>
    <p><strong>Ribosomes</strong> – smaller than eukaryotic ribosomes; site of protein synthesis.</p>

    <p><em>Prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles.</em></p>

    <h2>Exam-Grade Questions (Active Recall)</h2>

    <details>
        <summary>Explain the function of the mitochondria.</summary>
        The mitochondria are the site of aerobic respiration, where energy is released for cell activities.
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>State two structures found in plant cells but not animal cells.</summary>
        Chloroplasts and a permanent vacuole.
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Describe one difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.</summary>
        Prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus, whereas eukaryotic cells do.
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Why are plasmids important in bacteria?</summary>
        They can carry genes such as antibiotic resistance, increasing bacterial survival.
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Which cell structure is responsible for protein synthesis?</summary>
        Ribosomes.
    </details>
