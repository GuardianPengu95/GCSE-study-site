    <h2>Quick Revision: Cell Structure (Grade 9)</h2>
    <p><em>For full notes, use the Topic 1 pages above. This section is for fast recall.</em></p>

    <h3>Animal Cells</h3>
    <p><strong>Nucleus</strong> – contains DNA and controls cell activities.</p>
    <p><strong>Mitochondria</strong> – site of aerobic respiration where energy is released.</p>
    <p><strong>Ribosomes</strong> – site of protein synthesis.</p>
    <p><strong>Cell membrane</strong> – controls movement of substances into and out of the cell.</p>
    <p><strong>Cytoplasm</strong> – where most chemical reactions occur, controlled by enzymes.</p>

    <h3>Plant Cell Additions</h3>
    <p><strong>Cell wall</strong> – made of cellulose; supports and strengthens the cell.</p>
    <p><strong>Chloroplasts</strong> – contain chlorophyll to absorb light energy for photosynthesis.</p>
    <p><strong>Permanent vacuole</strong> – contains cell sap and maintains turgor pressure.</p>

    <h3>Prokaryotic Cells (Bacteria)</h3>
    <p><strong>Circular DNA</strong> – genetic material free in the cytoplasm (no nucleus).</p>
    <p><strong>Plasmids</strong> – small DNA rings; can carry genes such as antibiotic resistance.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Point</strong> – prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles.</p>

    <h2>Quick Active Recall</h2>

    <details>
        <summary>State two structures found in plant cells but not animal cells.</summary>
        Chloroplasts and a permanent vacuole. (Cell wall is also correct.)
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Explain the function of the mitochondria.</summary>
        The mitochondria are the site of aerobic respiration, where energy is released for cell activities.
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Describe one difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.</summary>
        Prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus; eukaryotic cells do (and may contain membrane-bound organelles).
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Why are plasmids important in bacteria?</summary>
        Plasmids can carry useful genes, such as antibiotic resistance, which increases survival.
