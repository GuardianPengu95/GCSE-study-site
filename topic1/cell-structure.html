<h2>Plant Cells</h2>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Permanent vacuole</td>
        <td>Contains cell sap and maintains turgor pressure, keeping the cell rigid.</td>

<h2>Prokaryotic Cells (Bacterial Cells)</h2>

        <th>Function</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Cell wall</td>

<p><strong>Key point:</strong> Prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Grade 9 Comparisons</h2>

<details>
    <summary>Compare prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (4 marks)</summary>
    Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, whereas prokaryotic cells do not.  
    Prokaryotic DNA is circular and free in the cytoplasm, while eukaryotic DNA is linear and enclosed in a nucleus.
</details>

<hr>

<h2>6-Mark Model Answer</h2>

<details>
    <summary>Describe the differences between animal, plant, and bacterial cells.</summary>
    Animal and plant cells are eukaryotic and contain a nucleus, mitochondria, ribosomes, cytoplasm, and a cell membrane.  
    Plant cells also contain chloroplasts for photosynthesis, a cellulose cell wall for support, and a permanent vacuole to maintain turgor pressure.  
    Bacterial cells are prokaryotic and do not have a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles. Their genetic material is circular and found free in the cytoplasm, and they may contain plasmids.

<h2>Active Recall Questions</h2>

<details>
    <summary>Which structures are unique to plant cells?</summary>
    Cell wall, chloroplasts, and a permanent vacuole.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What is the function of mitochondria?</summary>
    Site of aerobic respiration where energy is released.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Why are plasmids important in bacteria?</summary>
    They can carry genes such as antibiotic resistance, increasing survival.
