<h2>6-Mark Model Answer</h2>

<details>
<summary>Describe the differences between animal, plant, and bacterial cells.</summary>
Animal and plant cells are eukaryotic and contain a nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, mitochondria, and ribosomes.  
Plant cells also contain chloroplasts for photosynthesis, a cellulose cell wall for support, and a permanent vacuole to maintain turgor pressure.  
Bacterial cells are prokaryotic and do not have a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles. Their genetic material is circular and found free in the cytoplasm, and they may contain plasmids.
