<h1>Cell Transport</h1>
<p class="muted">
Grade 9 focus: explain movement of substances using particle reasoning and correct terminology.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="card">
    <p>Cells need to move substances in and out to survive. This happens by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Diffusion</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Osmosis</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Active transport</strong></li>
    </ul>
</div>

<hr>

<h2>Diffusion</h2>
<div class="card">
    <p><strong>Diffusion</strong> is the net movement of particles from an area of <strong>higher concentration</strong> to an area of <strong>lower concentration</strong>.</p>
    <p>This movement happens because particles move <strong>randomly</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Factors Affecting Rate of Diffusion</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Difference in concentration (steeper gradient = faster diffusion)</li>
        <li>Temperature (higher temperature = more kinetic energy)</li>
        <li>Surface area of the membrane</li>
        <li>Distance particles must travel</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<hr>

<h2>Osmosis</h2>
<div class="card">
    <p><strong>Osmosis</strong> is the diffusion of <strong>water</strong> across a <strong>partially permeable membrane</strong>.</p>
    <p>Water moves from an area of <strong>high water concentration</strong> (dilute solution) to an area of <strong>low water concentration</strong> (concentrated solution).</p>

    <h3>Effects on Animal and Plant Cells</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Animal cells</strong> may burst in a very dilute solution.</li>
        <li><strong>Plant cells</strong> become turgid in a dilute solution due to the cell wall.</li>
        <li>In concentrated solutions, plant cells become <strong>flaccid</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<hr>

<h2>Active Transport</h2>
<div class="card">
    <p><strong>Active transport</strong> moves substances from a <strong>lower concentration</strong> to a <strong>higher concentration</strong>.</p>
    <p>This process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Requires <strong>energy</strong> from respiration</li>
        <li>Uses <strong>carrier proteins</strong></li>
        <li>Allows cells to absorb substances even when concentrations are low</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Root hair cells absorbing mineral ions from soil.</p>

<h2>6-Mark Model Answer</h2>

<details>
    <summary>Explain the differences between diffusion, osmosis, and active transport.</summary>
    Diffusion is the net movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration due to random motion and does not require energy.  
    Osmosis is a special type of diffusion involving only water molecules moving across a partially permeable membrane from a dilute solution to a concentrated solution.  
    Active transport moves substances from a low concentration to a high concentration against the concentration gradient and requires energy from respiration and carrier proteins.
</details>

<h2>Active Recall</h2>

<details>
    <summary>Define diffusion.</summary>
    The net movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What is osmosis?</summary>
    The diffusion of water through a partially permeable membrane from a dilute to a concentrated solution.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Why does active transport require energy?</summary>
    Because substances are moved against the concentration gradient.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Name one factor that increases the rate of diffusion.</summary>
    Higher temperature / steeper concentration gradient / larger surface area.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Why don’t plant cells burst in dilute solutions?</summary>
    The cell wall provides structural support and prevents bursting.
