<h1>Cell Division (Mitosis)</h1>

AQA GCSE Biology Higher — complete specification coverage of the cell cycle and mitosis (including cancer links).

<h2>Big Idea</h2>
<div class="card">
    <p><strong>Mitosis</strong> is a type of cell division that produces <strong>two genetically identical</strong> daughter cells.</p>
    <p>Mitosis is used for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Growth</strong> (increasing cell number)</li>
        <li><strong>Repair</strong> (replacing damaged or worn-out cells)</li>
        <li><strong>Asexual reproduction</strong> (in some organisms)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<hr>

<h2>Key Terms (Exam Language)</h2>
<div class="card">
    <p><strong>Chromosomes</strong> – long, coiled DNA molecules found in the nucleus.</p>
    <p><strong>Gene</strong> – a small section of DNA that codes for a protein.</p>
    <p><strong>Genetically identical</strong> – same DNA / same genes as the original cell.</p>
</div>

<hr>

<h2>The Cell Cycle (Specification)</h2>
<div class="card">
    <p>The cell cycle has three main stages:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Interphase</strong> – the cell grows and <strong>copies its DNA</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Mitosis</strong> – the <strong>nucleus divides</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Cytokinesis</strong> – the cytoplasm and cell membrane divide to form <strong>two identical cells</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="muted">
        Grade 9 point: DNA is copied in interphase so each daughter cell receives a complete set of chromosomes.
    </p>
</div>

<h2>Stages of Mitosis</h2>
<div class="card">
    <p>The stages of mitosis are often remembered as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prophase</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Metaphase</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Anaphase</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Telophase</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Stage</th>
            <th>What happens (High-Mark Wording)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Prophase</td>
            <td>Chromosomes condense and become visible; the nuclear membrane breaks down.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Metaphase</td>
            <td>Chromosomes line up at the centre (equator) of the cell.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Anaphase</td>
            <td>Chromosomes are pulled to opposite poles of the cell.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Telophase</td>
            <td>Two nuclei form as nuclear membranes reform; chromosomes uncoil.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p class="muted">
        AQA often marks the outcome: mitosis forms <strong>two nuclei</strong>, then cytokinesis forms <strong>two genetically identical daughter cells</strong>.
    </p>

<h2>Mitosis and Cancer (Specification Link)</h2>
<div class="card">
    <p>
        In multicellular organisms, cell division is normally controlled.
        If cell division becomes <strong>uncontrolled</strong>, it can form a <strong>tumour</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Benign tumour</strong> – stays in one place (not cancer).</li>
        <li><strong>Malignant tumour</strong> – invades tissues and can spread (cancer).</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>6-Mark Model Answers</h2>

<details>
<summary>6 marks: Describe the cell cycle and explain why DNA must be copied before mitosis.</summary>
The cell cycle includes interphase, mitosis and cytokinesis. During interphase the cell grows and copies its DNA.  
Mitosis is when the nucleus divides and chromosomes are separated so each new nucleus receives a complete set.  
Cytokinesis then divides the cytoplasm and cell membrane to form two daughter cells.  
DNA must be copied before mitosis so that each daughter cell receives a full set of chromosomes.  
This produces two genetically identical daughter cells, which is important for growth and repair.

<details>
<summary>6 marks: Explain how mitosis is important for growth and repair.</summary>
Mitosis produces two genetically identical daughter cells.  
In growth, mitosis increases the number of cells so the organism becomes larger.  
In repair, mitosis replaces damaged or worn-out cells, maintaining tissue function.  
Because the daughter cells are genetically identical, they can perform the same function as the cells they replace.  
The DNA is copied before mitosis so each new cell has a full set of genetic information.
