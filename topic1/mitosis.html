<h1>Cell Division (Mitosis)</h1>
<p class="muted">
Grade 9 focus: use correct terms (chromosomes, nucleus, identical) and explain why mitosis matters.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Big Idea</h2>
<div class="card">
    <p><strong>Mitosis</strong> is a type of cell division that produces <strong>two genetically identical</strong> daughter cells.</p>
    <p>It is used for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Growth</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Repair</strong> (replacing damaged cells)</li>
        <li><strong>Asexual reproduction</strong> in some organisms</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<hr>

<h2>Key Terms (Learn These)</h2>
<div class="card">
    <p><strong>Chromosomes</strong> – long coiled DNA molecules found in the nucleus.</p>
    <p><strong>Gene</strong> – a section of DNA that codes for a protein.</p>
    <p><strong>Genetically identical</strong> – same DNA / same genes as the original cell.</p>
</div>

<hr>

<h2>The Cell Cycle (AQA Higher)</h2>
<div class="card">
    <p>The cell cycle has three main stages:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Interphase</strong> – the cell grows and <strong>copies its DNA</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Mitosis</strong> – the nucleus divides.</li>
        <li><strong>Cytokinesis</strong> – the cytoplasm and cell membrane divide to form two cells.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="muted">
        Grade 9 point: DNA must be copied in interphase so each daughter cell gets a complete set of chromosomes.
    </p>
</div>

<h2>Stages of Mitosis (What You Need to Know)</h2>
<div class="card">
    <p>The stages are often remembered as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prophase</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Metaphase</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Anaphase</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Telophase</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Stage</th>
            <th>What happens (Grade 9 wording)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Prophase</td>
            <td>Chromosomes condense and become visible; the nuclear membrane breaks down.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Metaphase</td>
            <td>Chromosomes line up at the centre (equator) of the cell.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Anaphase</td>
            <td>Chromosomes (sister chromatids) are pulled to opposite poles of the cell.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Telophase</td>
            <td>Two nuclei form as nuclear membranes reform; chromosomes uncoil.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p class="muted">
        AQA often focuses on outcomes: <strong>two nuclei</strong> form, then the cell splits to produce <strong>two identical cells</strong>.

<h2>Why Mitosis Matters (Exam Links)</h2>
<div class="card">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Growth:</strong> increases the number of cells in an organism.</li>
        <li><strong>Repair:</strong> replaces damaged or worn-out cells (e.g., skin cells).</li>
        <li><strong>Cancer link (higher):</strong> uncontrolled cell division can form tumours.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>6-Mark Model Answers</h2>

<details>
    <summary>6 marks: Describe the cell cycle and explain the role of mitosis.</summary>
    The cell cycle includes interphase, mitosis, and cytokinesis. During interphase the cell grows and copies its DNA so there are two sets of genetic material.  
    During mitosis the nucleus divides and the chromosomes are separated so that each new nucleus receives a complete set of chromosomes.  
    Cytokinesis then divides the cytoplasm and cell membrane to form two daughter cells.  
    The daughter cells are genetically identical, which is important for growth and for repairing damaged tissues.

<details>
    <summary>6 marks: Explain why DNA must be copied before mitosis.</summary>
    DNA is copied in interphase so there are two sets of genetic material available.  
    During mitosis the chromosomes are separated into two nuclei.  
    If DNA was not copied first, each daughter cell would receive only half the genetic information.  
    Copying DNA ensures each daughter cell has a full set of chromosomes and is genetically identical to the original cell.  
    This is essential for growth and repair because new cells must function the same as the cells they replace.

<h2>Active Recall</h2>

<details>
    <summary>What is mitosis?</summary>
    A type of cell division that produces two genetically identical daughter cells.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What happens in interphase?</summary>
    The cell grows and copies its DNA.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What happens in cytokinesis?</summary>
    The cytoplasm and cell membrane divide to form two separate cells.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Name the four stages of mitosis.</summary>
    Prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Why are daughter cells genetically identical after mitosis?</summary>
    Because DNA is copied before mitosis and chromosomes are separated equally so each new nucleus receives a complete set.
