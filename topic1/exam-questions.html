<hr>

<h2>Section A: Short Answer (1–2 marks)</h2>

<details>
<summary>1) State the function of the nucleus. (1 mark)</summary>
Contains genetic material (DNA) and controls the activities of the cell.
</details>

<details>
<summary>2) Name two structures found in plant cells but not animal cells. (2 marks)</summary>
Cell wall and chloroplasts. (Permanent vacuole also correct.)
</details>

<details>
<summary>3) Define diffusion. (2 marks)</summary>
The net movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.
</details>

<details>
<summary>4) Which type of cell division produces genetically identical cells? (1 mark)</summary>
Mitosis.
</details>

<details>
<summary>5) State one ethical concern about embryonic stem cells. (1 mark)</summary>
Embryos are destroyed during their use.
</details>

<hr>

<h2>Section B: Explain / Apply (3–4 marks)</h2>

<details>
<summary>6) Explain why electron microscopes have a higher resolution than light microscopes. (3 marks)</summary>
Electron microscopes use electrons instead of light.  
Electrons have a much shorter wavelength than light.  
This allows smaller structures to be distinguished, giving higher resolution.
</details>

<details>
<summary>7) Explain how osmosis affects a plant cell placed in a dilute solution. (4 marks)</summary>
Water moves into the cell by osmosis through a partially permeable membrane.  
Water enters the vacuole, increasing its volume.  
This creates turgor pressure, pushing the cytoplasm against the cell wall.  
The cell becomes turgid and rigid.
</details>

<details>
<summary>8) Explain why active transport requires energy. (3 marks)</summary>
Active transport moves substances from a low concentration to a high concentration.  
This movement is against the concentration gradient.  
Energy from respiration is required to do this.
</details>

<hr>

<h2>Section C: Calculations (4 marks)</h2>

<details>
<summary>9) An image of a cell is 40 mm long. The real cell is 10 µm long. Calculate the magnification. (4 marks)</summary>
Convert 40 mm to µm: 40 mm = 40,000 µm (1 mark).  
Magnification = image size ÷ real size (1 mark).  
40,000 ÷ 10 = 4000 (1 mark).  
Magnification = 4000× (1 mark).
</details>

<hr>

<h2>Section D: 6-Mark Questions (Higher)</h2>

<details>
<summary>10) Describe the differences between animal, plant, and bacterial cells. (6 marks)</summary>
Animal and plant cells are eukaryotic and contain a nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, mitochondria, and ribosomes.  
Plant cells also contain chloroplasts for photosynthesis, a cellulose cell wall for support, and a permanent vacuole to maintain turgor pressure.  
Bacterial cells are prokaryotic and do not have a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles.  
Their genetic material is circular and found free in the cytoplasm, and they may contain plasmids.
</details>

<details>
<summary>11) Describe the cell cycle and explain the importance of mitosis. (6 marks)</summary>
The cell cycle includes interphase, mitosis, and cytokinesis.  
During interphase the cell grows and copies its DNA.  
Mitosis is when the nucleus divides and chromosomes are separated into two nuclei.  
Cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm and cell membrane to form two daughter cells.  
The daughter cells are genetically identical, which is important for growth and repair.
</details>

<details>
<summary>12) Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using embryonic stem cells. (6 marks)</summary>
Embryonic stem cells can differentiate into any type of body cell, giving them great potential for treating diseases.  
They could be used to replace damaged cells or grow new tissues.  
However, embryos are destroyed during the process, which raises ethical concerns.  
Some people believe embryos have a right to life, while others argue the benefits outweigh the ethical issues.
