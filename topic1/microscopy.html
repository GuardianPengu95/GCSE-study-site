    <p><strong>Resolution</strong> – the ability to distinguish two close points as separate (higher resolution = more detail).</p>

<h2>Required Practical: Using a Light Microscope to Observe Cells</h2>

<div class="card">
    <h3>How to Prepare a Slide (High Mark Method)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a <strong>drop of water</strong> on a clean slide.</li>
        <li>Add a <strong>thin specimen</strong> using tweezers (thin = clearer image).</li>
        <li>Add a <strong>stain</strong> (e.g., iodine) if needed to increase contrast.</li>
        <li>Lower the <strong>coverslip at an angle</strong> to avoid trapping air bubbles.</li>
        <li>Remove excess liquid with paper towel if needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How to Use the Microscope (High Mark Method)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start with the <strong>lowest magnification</strong> objective lens.</li>
        <li>Use the focusing controls to get a sharp image.</li>
        <li>Increase magnification to see more detail (refocus each time).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Common Exam Errors (Avoid These)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Air bubbles</strong> reduce image quality and can be mistaken for structures.</li>
        <li>Too thick a specimen means <strong>light cannot pass through</strong> clearly.</li>
        <li>Starting on high magnification makes it harder to find the specimen.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<hr>

<h2>Magnification Calculations (Specification)</h2>

<div class="card">
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Magnification = image size ÷ real size</strong></p>
    <p class="muted">
You must use the same units for image size and real size.
</p>

    <h3>Unit Conversions You Must Know</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1 mm = 1000 µm</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 µm = 0.001 mm</strong></li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h3>Worked Example 1 (Typical AQA Style)</h3>
    <p>Image size = <strong>36 mm</strong>, real size = <strong>12 µm</strong>. Find magnification.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Convert 36 mm to µm: 36 mm = 36,000 µm</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Magnification = 36,000 ÷ 12 = <strong>3000×</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h3>Worked Example 2 (Rearranging the Formula)</h3>
    <p>Magnification = <strong>400×</strong>, image size = <strong>20 mm</strong>. Find real size.</p>
    <p><strong>Real size = image size ÷ magnification</strong></p>
    <p>Real size = 20 ÷ 400 = <strong>0.05 mm</strong> = <strong>50 µm</strong></p>
</div>

<h2>6-Mark Model Answers</h2>

<details>
<summary>6 marks: Compare light microscopes and electron microscopes.</summary>
Light microscopes use light and have lower resolution and magnification, so they show less detail.  
Electron microscopes use electrons and have higher magnification and much higher resolution because electrons have a shorter wavelength than light.  
This means electron microscopes can show the ultrastructure inside cells, such as membranes and ribosomes.  
However, electron microscopes require a vacuum so living specimens cannot be observed, whereas light microscopes can sometimes observe living cells.
</details>

<details>
<summary>6 marks: Describe how to prepare a slide and obtain a clear image using a light microscope.</summary>
A drop of water is placed onto a clean slide and a thin specimen is added using tweezers.  
A stain such as iodine may be added to increase contrast so structures are easier to observe.  
A coverslip is lowered at an angle to avoid trapping air bubbles which reduce image quality.  
The microscope is started on the lowest magnification lens to locate the specimen and focusing controls are used to make the image sharp.  
Magnification can then be increased to see more detail, refocusing each time to maintain a clear image.

<h2>Active Recall (All Spec Points)</h2>

<details><summary>Define magnification.</summary>How many times bigger an image is than the real object.</details>
<details><summary>Define resolution.</summary>The ability to distinguish two close points as separate.</details>
<details><summary>Why do electron microscopes have higher resolution?</summary>Electrons have a shorter wavelength than light.</details>
<details><summary>Why should you start with the lowest magnification lens?</summary>It makes it easier to find the specimen before increasing magnification.</details>
<details><summary>Convert 0.25 mm into µm.</summary>0.25 mm = 250 µm.</details>
<details><summary>If the image is 45,000 µm and the real size is 15 µm, what is the magnification?</summary>45,000 ÷ 15 = 3000×.</details>
