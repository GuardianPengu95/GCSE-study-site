<h2>Required Practical: Preparing a Slide</h2>
<div class="card">
    <h3>Method (High Mark Version)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a drop of water on a clean slide.</li>
        <li>Use tweezers to place a thin sample onto the water (thin = clearer image).</li>
        <li>Add a drop of stain (e.g., iodine) if needed to increase contrast.</li>
        <li>Lower the coverslip carefully at an angle to avoid trapping air bubbles.</li>
        <li>Use the lowest magnification objective lens first, then increase magnification.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Common Exam Pitfalls</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Air bubbles</strong> reduce image quality and can be mistaken for structures.</li>
        <li>If the specimen is too thick, <strong>light cannot pass through clearly</strong>.</li>
        <li>Start at low magnification so you <strong>can find the specimen</strong> before zooming in.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>Magnification Calculations (Grade 9)</h2>
<div class="card">
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Magnification = image size ÷ real size</strong></p>
    <p class="muted">You must use the same units for both sizes (convert mm ↔ µm if needed).</p>

    <h3>Unit Conversions You Must Know</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 mm = 1000 µm</li>
        <li>1 µm = 0.001 mm</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h3>Worked Example 1</h3>
    <p>An image of a cell is <strong>45 mm</strong>. The real cell is <strong>15 µm</strong>. Find the magnification.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Convert 45 mm to µm: 45 mm = 45,000 µm</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Magnification = 45,000 ÷ 15 = <strong>3000×</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h3>Worked Example 2</h3>
    <p>The magnification is <strong>400×</strong>. The image size is <strong>20 mm</strong>. Find the real size.</p>
    <p><strong>Rearrange:</strong> Real size = image size ÷ magnification</p>
    <p>Real size = 20 mm ÷ 400 = <strong>0.05 mm</strong> = <strong>50 µm</strong></p>

<h2>6-Mark Model Answers</h2>

<details>
    <summary>6 marks: Compare light and electron microscopes.</summary>
    Light microscopes use light and have lower resolution and lower magnification, so they show fewer details.  
    Electron microscopes use electrons and have much higher resolution because electrons have a shorter wavelength, allowing smaller structures to be distinguished.  
    Electron microscopes can show internal ultrastructure such as membranes and ribosomes, but specimens must be in a vacuum so living cells cannot be observed.  
    Light microscopes can sometimes view living specimens, but cannot show as much detail.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>6 marks: Describe how to prepare a slide for a light microscope and how to get a clear image.</summary>
    A drop of water is placed onto a clean slide and a thin specimen is added using tweezers.  
    A stain such as iodine may be added to increase contrast so structures are easier to see.  
    A coverslip is lowered at an angle to avoid trapping air bubbles which reduce image quality.  
    The microscope is started on low magnification to locate the specimen, then the objective lens is increased to view more detail.  
    Focusing is adjusted to produce a sharp image, and keeping the specimen thin allows light to pass through clearly.

<h2>Active Recall (Test Yourself)</h2>

<details>
    <summary>Define magnification.</summary>
    How many times bigger an image is than the real object.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Define resolution.</summary>
    The ability to distinguish two close points as separate (more detail).
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Why can electron microscopes see more detail than light microscopes?</summary>
    Electrons have a shorter wavelength than light, giving higher resolution.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Why do you start on the lowest magnification first?</summary>
    To find the specimen more easily before increasing magnification.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Convert 0.12 mm into µm.</summary>
    0.12 mm = 120 µm (multiply by 1000).
</details>

<details>
    <summary>If an image is 30,000 µm and the real object is 10 µm, what is the magnification?</summary>
    Magnification = 30,000 ÷ 10 = 3000×.
