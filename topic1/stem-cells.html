<h2>What Are Stem Cells?</h2>
<div class="card">
    <p>
        <strong>Stem cells</strong> are <strong>undifferentiated cells</strong> that can:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Divide by mitosis</li>
        <li>Differentiate into different types of specialised cells</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<hr>

<h2>Cell Differentiation</h2>
<div class="card">
    <p>
        <strong>Differentiation</strong> is the process by which a cell changes to become
        <strong>specialised</strong> for a specific function.
    </p>
    <p>
        In animals, most cells differentiate early in development.  
        In plants, many cells retain the ability to differentiate throughout their lives.

<h2>Types of Stem Cells</h2>

<h3>Embryonic Stem Cells</h3>
<div class="card">
    <ul>
        <li>Found in early human embryos</li>
        <li>Can differentiate into <strong>any type of body cell</strong></li>
        <li>Have the greatest potential for medical use</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h3>Adult Stem Cells</h3>
<div class="card">
    <ul>
        <li>Found in adult tissues (e.g. bone marrow)</li>
        <li>Can differentiate into a <strong>limited range</strong> of cells</li>
        <li>Used in treatments such as bone marrow transplants</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h3>Plant Stem Cells</h3>
<div class="card">
    <ul>
        <li>Found in meristems (e.g. root and shoot tips)</li>
        <li>Can differentiate into many plant cell types</li>
        <li>Used in cloning plants and producing identical copies</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>Uses of Stem Cells</h2>
<div class="card">
    <ul>
        <li>Treating conditions such as paralysis and diabetes</li>
        <li>Replacing damaged or diseased cells</li>
        <li>Growing new tissues or organs in the future</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>Risks and Ethical Issues</h2>

<h3>Risks</h3>
<div class="card">
    <ul>
        <li>Stem cells may be rejected by the patient’s immune system</li>
        <li>They may divide uncontrollably and form tumours</li>
        <li>Some treatments are still experimental</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h3>Ethical Issues (Embryonic Stem Cells)</h3>
<div class="card">
    <ul>
        <li>Embryos are destroyed during the process</li>
        <li>Some people believe embryos have a right to life</li>
        <li>Others argue embryos are clusters of cells and could save lives</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>6-Mark Model Answers</h2>

<details>
<summary>6 marks: Describe stem cells and explain their potential uses.</summary>
Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that can divide by mitosis and differentiate into specialised cells.  
Embryonic stem cells can differentiate into any type of body cell, while adult stem cells can only form a limited range.  
Stem cells can be used to replace damaged or diseased cells, for example in treating paralysis or diabetes.  
They may also be used to grow new tissues or organs in the future.  
However, some treatments are experimental and stem cells may be rejected by the immune system or form tumours.
</details>

<details>
<summary>6 marks: Discuss the ethical issues associated with the use of embryonic stem cells.</summary>
Embryonic stem cells are obtained from early embryos, which are destroyed in the process.  
Some people believe embryos have a right to life and that destroying them is unethical.  
Others argue embryos are clusters of undifferentiated cells and that using them could save lives.  
Embryonic stem cells have greater ability to differentiate than adult stem cells, making them valuable for medical research.  
The ethical debate involves balancing the potential benefits of treatments against moral concerns.
